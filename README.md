# Python-Better-Caesar-cipher

### Description
This is a programs to encrypt and decrypt messege by Ceasar cipher. It's better than common Caesar cipher because you can choose the shift value in range [1,25] (1 because 0 and lower doesn't make any sens, 25 because aplhabet has 26 char so "a" shifted 25 is "z").
## Encrpytion
To encrypt your messege run file "Encryption.py" with commend:
### 'python3 Encryption.py'
#### Example
##### Input:
* Python3 is cool!
* 15
##### Output:
* Eniwdc8 xh rdda!

## Decryption 
To decrypt your cipher run file "Decryption.py" with commend:
### 'python3 Decryption.py'
#### Example
##### Input:
* Eniwdc8 xh rdda!
* 15
##### Output:
* Python3 is cool!
